*** Components
**** Walk a Clojure Project to get all the def's and defns
**** Walk each of those and grab all the words used in there
***** Identify which are the parameters
**** Compare that with the functions 
***** required at the top of the namespace
***** def'd throughout the project

**** Generate a List of all the functions in the project

***** Clicking on a function reveals the functions it is made of

***** Sort the list based on which things are required in more places

***** On each function, show the number of component functions it has



**** Generate a List of functions that you know

***** Clicking a button on a function adds it to your list


**** Show a ratio of "known to unknown" component functions

***** It is possible to know a function without knowing its components

When you change the title of a note -- you will want to see the note across all of its contexts
It is possible, that rather than changing the title the note has in all of those locations, you will want to change it in only some locations and
[[Alias Note]] the note in other ones
* Alias Note
Adding a different header which points to the same note, related to [[Cloning a Note]]

* Create Context for Note Titles       :reading:typing:indentation:structure:

When creating note titles -- you should be able to somehow specify the shared context between a number of links

For example

in a block where I am going to be looking for ways to achieve some piece of functionality using clojure, it is distracting to the eye, and to the writer to have to place
   Clojure:  Find the current directory
   Clojure:  Parse a string for a regular expression

Instead I should be able to say

   Clojure:
       Find the current Directory
       Parse a string for a regular Expression
