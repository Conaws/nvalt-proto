- Possible implementation 1:
	- As one is typing, an event handler updates the [[global state atom]] with checks to see whether the last two characters in the text area were "[\[" (start of a link)
	- If they were, then the text area's String value is modified according to what the user types after the "[\[". Uses a [[search indexer]] on the [[In-memory database]] to find text which matches all note titles.
	- The event handler stops listening after the user types "]\]".
