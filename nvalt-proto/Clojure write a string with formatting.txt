PS2: Sometimes it's handy to be able to see what the current directory (so ".") is. You can get the absolute path in two ways:
(System/getProperty "user.dir") 

(-> (java.io.File. ".") .getAbsolutePath)



PS: To be more explicit about the fact that you are reading and writing to a File and not something else, you could first create a File object and then coerce it into a BufferedReader or Writer:
(reader (file "/tmp/test.txt"))
;; or
(writer (file "tmp/test.txt"))
The file function is also in clojure.java.io.
