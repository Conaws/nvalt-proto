Among possible [[Priorities]]


#Goal:

##	Be able to visually observe the following
*	The open questions that I am trying to answer
	* What sub questions must I answer to answer these questions 
		* Why do I think this sub-question is relevant
		
*	The potential answers I am pursuing to those questions
	* 	The level of completeness of an investigation
		*	Whether the investigation is current
	*	How satisfied I am with the answer to a question

*	What evidence I have that an answer is complete
	* For What reason do I believe this fact is true
	* For what reason do I believe this fact is relevant to this question

## Exploratory Questions 

* Why would someone want to structure their thinking in such a modular way?
	* Even though it would take a great deal of effort to outline one's thoughts in such a way
	* It would be very much worth it if this greatly reduced the coordination effort 

* What is the value of creating visual representations of the relationships drawn out in language?
	* For example consider a statement like the one above: 
		* Even though x, y would cause z if a and b.  
		* In a single line of text a huge number of loose logical relationships can be expressed. 
	
	* What is limiting about this kind of an expression is that it doesn't take advantage of the interactive options that the new environment provides
		* Particularly for exploration, personalization, and a high level overview of the results of how debates on details can affect the overall premise

* Is this problem best addressed by UI design, or parsing plaintext?		aka
	* How Is this problem best addressed
		* UI design
		* parsing plaintext		
		

## For consideration (Evidence/Assertions)

* Tables of contents and other ways of breaking content down are important
	* As they allow for better scanning
	* + modularization
	* But they create greater problems if you can't see them side by side to see how they influence one another


* If it is possible to make a more modular/composable way of expressing a fact/thought, than changing it in one place could change it in  many other places 

* If you could actually represent how ideas flow together, or how on premise is built off another, than changing an idea in one area, or discovering a new fact, could trigger alerts that the new ideas repercussions have weight in other places

* Identifying the relationships between ideas will also show the valuable, unexplored territory that is of potentially high consequence

* The UI, especially for a teaching tool, will impart habits of mind on the users, especially young ones, if it is successful

* A focus on evidence has hints of logical positivism built into the UI 
	-- it suggests that the path to greater knowledge is the constant collection of evidence
	-- this is not good, especially if it favors searching for evidence to support the position you wish to take
	-- however [[Collecting Evidence]]
