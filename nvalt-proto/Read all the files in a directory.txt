	[[Find Current Directory]]
	[[Get all files in a Directory]]

Get all the files in a directory
	[[clojure.core/file-seq]]
		Performs a recursive search for all the files in a directory

Read each file as a text string
	Clojure.core/slurp

Do the same thing to each file
	clojure.core/map 
	
	

#Solution
	(defn read-files
	  [path]
	  (->> path
	       (File.)
	       file-seq
	       (filter #(is-text-file? (str %)))
	       (map file-to-vec)))
	


#Test
	(= (first (read-files "test"))
	    ["File 1" "[[File 2]] "])
